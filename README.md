# GoLang Server Boilerplate
This git serves as a boilerplate for that who are having a hard time creating an HTTP server using GoLang. Within it includes a custom logger and uses the bogdanfinn library to bring in support for a TLS client. This git also includes how routes are structured and I've included a /token route that generates a JWT token.

## Installation

3. go run ./src/server.go
